This in an example R project setup for deployment on a docker container, running and connecting a docker container that runs R. 

* Set up a dockerfile 
* Set up a composer file
* Build a container
* Run a container with Rstudio
* Connect to that container and run a script
* Write the output back to a mounted data folder on the host
* Look at how to set up other connections that you might use often
